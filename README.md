# Forest-Fire-Detection
Developing a CNN-based system for early forest fire detection is crucial to safeguard the environment, wildlife, and human lives. This project focuses on using deep learning techniques to create a model that can efficiently identify forest fires, enabling prompt and effective firefighting measures. Introducing cutting-edge CNN-based Forest Fire Detection Model, Safeguarding the environment, wildlife, and lives is our priority. Early detection is key, and our advanced deep learning technology ensures swift identification of potential forest fires. Experience the power of innovation for effective and timely firefighting.
